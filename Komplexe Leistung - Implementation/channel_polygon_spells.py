# This function "normalizes" any quadrilateral and its associated points into a 1x1 square. We achieve this without
 # having to resort to complex algebra but only using relatively simple geometry (but a lot of it)
def warped_polygon_channels(t0, tn, left_posts, right_posts):

    # if the ll- and rr-line of the initial channel polygon (rectangle, known as the Jur-eck in the original German)
    # are not parallel to each other, they have a common origin outside the channel polygon which is also the shared
    # origin of all isoclines with rr and ll being the most extreme isoclines at 0 and 1. These are the latitude values
    # TODO: parallel goals or ll/rr lines are not part of the exercises so we ignore this edge case.
    # Analogously, we can construct the longitutde values using t0 and tn

    # treating the lines as linear functions, we can find their intersection (the "origin")
     # This means, that we construct a slope from the interval and use that to determine the intercept et voil√°, we have
     # a linear function. These functions cross at some point if they are not parallel (again, not relevant for our
     # project) and we name the resulting intersection the "origin" for the latitude or longitude readings respecitvely.
     # The name comes from the idea that any initial rectangle is an intersection of 2 pairs of lines (t0 and tn as the
     # first pair and ll and rr as the second pair) and each pair originates from a single point. The huge advantage
     # this way is that if you connect any point within the channel polygon with the origin of one pair, it will cross
     # both lines of the other pair at exactly the same proportion. Try it out for yourself! This way, we can now play
     # the game as though we had a 1x1 square - we just use the latitude and longitude values that will always be
     # between 0 and 1. If a point is outside of the channel polygon, we flatly set the value to -1 if it is outside the
     # polygon but closer to t0 than tn for latitude and 2 in the other case and for longitude, we set it to -1 if it is
     # outside the channel polygon but closer to ll than to rr. See the implementations of linear intersection and get
     # anchor for details.

    # the respective size is stored as we'll need it later

    #  polygon. We could remedy this in the preprocessing but it's not important for now.
